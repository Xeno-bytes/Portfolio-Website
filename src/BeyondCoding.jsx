                When I am not at my desk coding, I love to immerse myself in a video game. I have a deep love for games that challenges my brain to solve problems that the game provides while experiencing their story.

                Solving the puzzles of a dungeon or optimizing a team composition to beat an enemy is just another form of debugging to me!
